            <h4 class="nameOfDefinition">Logic Gate</h4>
            <p>It is an idealized or physical device implementing a Boolean function; that is, it performs a logical operation
                on one or more binary inputs and produces a single binary output.</p>
            <h4 class="nameOfDefinition">ACSII Code</h4>
            <p>It stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange. Computers can only understand numbers, so it is
                the numerical representation of a character such as 'a' or '@' or an action of some sort.</p>
            <h4 class="nameOfDefinition">Random-access memory (RAM)</h4>
            <p>It is a form of computer data storage which stores frequently used program instructions to increase the general
                speed of a system. It can be randomly accessed. Data items to be read or written in almost the same amount of
                time irrespective of the physical location of data inside the memory.</p>
            <h4 class="nameOfDefinition">Programing languages</h4>
            <p>A formal language that specifies a set of instructions that can be used to produce various kinds of output. They
                generally consist of instructions for a computer and can be used to create programs that implement specific
                algorithms.</p>
            <h4 class="nameOfDefinition">Domain name Systems</h4>
            <p>A hierarchical decentralized naming system for computers, services, or other resources connected to the Internet
